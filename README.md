This project has been discontinued for the time being, though it may be revived in a few years when the project that used it prior to a switch of focus, <b><a href="https://github.com/Marin-MK/RPG-Studio-MK">RPG Studio MK</a></b>, is on more stable ground and looks more to the future. Note that this project was complete, and that it could still be used. No documentation exists, however.

<h2>peridot</h2>

Written in C#, peridot provides bindings between Ruby and <a href="https://github.com/Marin-MK/odl">odl</a> using <a href="https://github.com/Marin-MK/rubydotnet">rubydotnet</a>. This gives Ruby the opportunity to display and manage graphics with C#, thereby also allowing C# to communicate with Ruby.
